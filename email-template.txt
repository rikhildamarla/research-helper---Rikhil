            EMAIL TEMPLATE TO FILL (USE EXACTLY THIS TEMPLATE):
            Dear Professor [last_name],

            Hope this email finds you well.
            I had a quick question on your paper regarding [insert the subject of the paper relating to my research on this topic: Can Financial Predictive Models Detect Early Signs of Gentrification Risk for Vulnerable Communities?]:
             - [Write the question here, make sure it relates to the project mentioned earlier]

            The reason I'm asking is because I'm working on a project in a similar vertical on If Financial Predictive Models can Detect Gentrification Risk.
            I would also love to have a quick chat to hear your thoughts on my project, as I am pretty early into my research journey and am looking for some direction.

            Would a 15 minute chat work for you sometime soon?

            Any response would mean a lot as I work toward pursuing my dream of contributing to this field. If you are unable to assist but know someone who might, I would greatly appreciate it if you could kindly redirect me to them.
            (Resume attached to give a bit of background)

            Kind regards,
            Rikhil Damarla
