Dear [title] [last_name]

Hope this email finds you well.

I had a quick question on your paper regarding [insert the subject of the paper relating to your research paper]:
 - [Insert the question here, make sure it relates to the project you want to do]

The reason I’m asking is because I’m working on a project in a similar vertical on [look at my resume to pick out the project I am working on that is similar]. 

Attached is a project proposal that describes it in more detail. 

I would also love to have a quick chat to hear your thoughts on my project, as I am pretty early into my research journey and am looking for some direction.

Would a 15 minute chat work for you sometime soon? If so, please feel free to book a time on my calendar here:

Again, thank you for your time. Any response would mean a lot as I work toward pursuing my dream of contributing to this field.

Kind regards,
Rikhil Damarla
